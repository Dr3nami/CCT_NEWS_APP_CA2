News reading appl for CA2 of Mobile Development Module CCT

The news app provides users with the latest news articles and features a clean and user-friendly design. The functionality includes displaying a list of articles, allowing users to view article details, and providing options to like, share, and bookmark articles. As well as allowing for the selection of a chosen category from the tabs at the top of the page, and the option of searching for specific articles or preferred news provider. 

The design process focused on creating an intuitive layout and optimizing the user experience. Challenges were faced when retrieving data from news sources and accessing images from Irish websites through the API. To overcome this, I need to change the country code to the United States for broader access to articles with images. I tried to add a loop to remove any articles where to urlToimage values were “null,” but this left me with only two Irish websites, and it significantly took away from the look of the site. 

Overall, the app successfully delivers a live news browsing experience. The design is user-friendly, and challenges related to data retrieval, image access, and responsive design were addressed. The app caters to news-hungry users, providing up-to-date articles in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
